add feature to this project where users can generate quiz/flashcards from topic that they type in the single line field text. pre-filled the field text with example "English Grammar Past Tense". below the field text provide several  sample topics where it will prefill the field text if it is clicked by users. serveral sample topics are : "Alternative Energy and Sustainability", "Diponegoro and the Java War", "Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation", "Molecular Genetics and DNA". named this new content source as "Text" and re-arrange the content source buttons to become two rows, two above and two below. 
Since this will be generating quiz/flashcards from a topic instead of document, so you will need to create new prompt for each and put in @/backend/prompts/generate_quiz_from_topic.md and @/backend/prompts/generate_flashcard_from_topic.md.
