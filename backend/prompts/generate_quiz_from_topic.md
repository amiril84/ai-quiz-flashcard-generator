   - Draw upon your comprehensive knowledge about this topic
   - Cover the most important concepts, principles, and applications

3. **Question Variety**:

   - Avoid simple recall/memorization questions
   - Test deep understanding of the subject matter

4. **Difficulty Calibration**:
   - **Default**: Medium to difficult questions (unless topic specifies otherwise)
   - **Beginner level detected**: Focus on fundamental concepts, clear explanations
   - **Intermediate/College level detected**: More challenging questions, require deeper understanding
   - **Advanced level detected**: Complex scenarios, synthesis of multiple concepts

5. **Question Quality**:
   - Each question should be clear, unambiguous, and well-written
   - All 4 options should be plausible to someone who hasn't mastered the topic

   - Include theoretical knowledge and practical applications
   - Progress logically from foundational to more complex concepts
